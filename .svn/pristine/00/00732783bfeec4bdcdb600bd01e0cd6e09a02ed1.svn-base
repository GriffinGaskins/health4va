				<h2>Graduation Rates of Virginia Doctors</h2>
				<span class="byline">By: Griffin Gaskins</span> </div>
			<p>Has Virginia stopped graduating doctors, or has the state simply stopped keeping track?
			   Well, lets check the sources to start. <a href="http://data.virginia.gov/hhr">Virginia Health and Human Resources Data</a> hosts information about the graduation rates of doctors. The last report which was released in January 2016 suggests that an issue may exist with Virginia's record keeping.

			</p>
			<p> The doctors graduation rates are<a href="http://www.dhp.virginia.gov/downloads/profiledata.asp"> found here</a>; when the data is scrubbed, unfilled information or incorrectly filled rows removed, it begins to tell an interesting story. We selected the last 16 years (2000-2016) and found a decreasing trend in the graduation of doctors.  Starting around the early 2000s reported graudation of doctors topped out at approximately 630 doctors graduating from the state per year.</p>

			<div id="chart1" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"></div>

			<p>After only a few years, we begin to see a steep decline in the reported graduation of doctors in Virginia.
			By 2010 the graduation rates are nearly half those of a decade ago. Currently, in the last full year (2015) we reported a full <strong>seven</strong> graduated doctors!</p>

			<p>What could be happening here? Did Virginia really only graduate seven doctors in 2015? Well, no, almost certainly not. Virginia graduates many doctors every year. I alone know three people who either are in medical school or will be within one year. There could be many reasons why Virginia is not keeping track of this information. Could it be that they have switched there record keeping in the last few years, and this steep decline is just a result of no longer recording this information in the same place?</p>

			<p>Maybe, but in the end who knows? Hopefully someone who sees this can do something about it.</p>
